# My_stack
Documentation
    Stack.h is a file with functions for using stack in it.
    It has constructor, destructor, push, pop, back and resize.
    There is also defend from wrong using of it.

    This stack works only with doubles.
    If any function gets errors not like STACK_OK, they send it to stack_dump.
    At the end the last information about stack will be added to log_file, that will be generated itself.
